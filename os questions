25. 1. Consider the following statements about process state transitions for a
system using preemptive scheduling. I. A running process can move to a ready state

Answer:C
26.Let the time taken to switch from user mode to kernel mode of execution
be T1 while time taken to switch between two user processes be T2. Which of the
following is correct?
A. T1>T2
B. T1=T2
C. T1<T2
D. Nothing can be said about the relation between T1 and T2
Answer:C
Time taken to switch two processes is very large as compared to time taken to
switch between kernel and user mode of execution because :
When you switch processes, you have to do a context switch, save the PCB of
previous process (note that the PCB of a process in Linux has over 95 entries), then
save registers and then load the PCB of new process and load its registers etc.
When you switch between kernel and user mode of execution, OS has to
just change a single bit at hardware level which is very fast operation.
So, answer is: (C).
27. The following are some events that occur after a device controller issues an
interrupt while process L is under execution.
(P) The processor pushes the process status of L onto the control stack.
(Q) The processor finishes the execution of the current instruction.
(R) The processor executes the interrupt service
routine.
(S) The processor pops the process status of L from the control stack.
(T) The processor loads the new PC value based on the interrupt.
Which one of the following is the correct order in which the events above occur?
a. QPTRS
b. PTRSQ
c. TRPQS
d. QTPRS
Answer : A
28. Which one of the following is FALSE?
(a) User-level threads are not scheduled by the kernel.
(b) When a user-level thread is blocked, all other threads of its process are blocked.
(c) Context switching between user-level thread is faster than context switching
between kernel-level threads.
(d) Kernel level threads cannot share the code segment.
Answer : We know that kernel level threads can share the code segment therefore
option (d) is false. Hence the correct option is (d)
