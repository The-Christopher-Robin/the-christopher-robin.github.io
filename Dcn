Design and simulate a wired network with duplex links between 3 nodes with CDR over
UDP. Set the queue size vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

traffic-controll.cc copy
delete full void function below NS_LOG above int main(int argc)


NodeContainer nodes;
nodes.Create(3); not 2

make it 
NetDeviceContainer devices01
devices01 = pointToPoint.Install(nodes.Get(0), nodes.Get(1));
NetDeviceContainer devices12
devices12 = pointToPoint.Install(nodes.Get(1), nodes.Get(2));

two lines later
delete entirely trafficcontrolhelper tch onwards till makecallback(devicepacket soemthing) below stack.install
above ipv4address helper

after ipv4address helper address
addrees.setbase("10.1.1.0"....)
Ipv4InterfaceContainer interfaces01 = address.assign(devices01)
copy and paste again
addrees.setbase("10.1.2.0"....)
Ipv4InterfaceContainer interfaces12 = address.assign(devices12)


within //flow

first para last line, nodes.Get(2));

first inetsocketaddress appearance: (interfaces12.GetAddress(1)...)
same para, nodes.get(0)

delete entirely uniter32_t onwards till the end ((((KEEP SIMULATOR::DESTROY() and RETURN0;}



copy third.cc from tutorial
copy this line: Ipv4GlobalRoutingHelper::PopulateRoutingTables():


paste in main file below Ipv4interfaceContainer interfaces12
paste here: Ipv4GlobalRoutingHelper::PopulateRoutingTables():

change line inside main function if(transportProt.compare("Udp")
./waf --run labfilename
./waf --run labfilename --vis


next ns3 question

copy third.cc
paste in headers from traffic control.cc
include flow-monitor..

towards the end
delete from UdpEchoServerHelper till end of if statement.
keep last 3 lines(simulator run, destroy return 0})
