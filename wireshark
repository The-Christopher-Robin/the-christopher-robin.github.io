ICMP
First open wireshark using terminal and start capture 
Then open terminal new window and type ping www.youtube.com 
And come back to terminal and stop capturing
Type icmp, sort with time and write answers


DHCP:
open terminal
type sudo dhclient -r
Enter lab2msrit as password
Type sudo dhclient
Type sudo dhclient -r, it'll say killed client process
In wireshark filters type bootp, stop packet capture


Http just
Start wireshark from terminal start capture
And 
Open that given website
And close it 
Stop capture
Search for http


DNS it similar to http only
Open wireshark using terminal then start capturing
Then open some random website or website they have mentioned
After sometime stop the packet capture 
In filter search for DNS and answer the questions
You might want to filter your ip address, find it by typing ip.addr== but Aneesh says it's not required



Extended service set program:
Comment from UdpEcho till if tracing is true ends
Copy routing table and from unit16 till std::endl for bytesdroppedbyqueuedisc from Traffic control
Change socketType to "ns3::UdpSocketFactory"
Change nodes.Get(0) to csmaNodes.Get(2) 
Change simulationTime to 10 everywhere
Comment config line
Change interfaces to csmaInterfaces.Get(1) 
Change nodes.Get(1) to wifiStaNodes.Get(0)


Lab 6(Generate two traffic flows) :
In examples go to wireless and then copy wifi-simple-adhoc.cc to scratch
Copy all headers from traffic control
Change c.create to 4
Add two positionalloc add vector lines with parameters 15.0,5.0,0.0 and 20.0,5.0,0.0
After ipv4interfacecontainer remove everything and then copy from flow till std::endl
After simulator:run comment till end till simulator destroy
Change socketType to "ns3::UdpSocketFactory"
Change nodes.Get(0) to c.Get(1) 
Change simulatorTime to 10
Change interfaces.GetAddress(0) to i.GetAddress(1) in Inet
Change nodes.Get(1) to c.Get(0)

Application Container sinkapp= smth smth (nodes. Get(2)
Some 2 or 3 lines below flow



NS3 1:
Remove everything after NS_LOG... till int main
Change Tcp to Udp
Make nodes.create(3) 
Make two devices, and in parameters nodes.Get(0) like that for 1 and then 12
After stack.Install comment till Ipv4
Make two interfaces also , add another address 10.1.2.0
Add routing table before Flow
Change nodes.Get to 2
Make it interfaces12 and 1 for Inet
Again nodes.Get(0) 
Comment when second uint32 starts till Simulator Destroy
Before routing table change it to interfaces12 and devices12


4nodes
But that source thing to 0 instead of 1
That apps.Add?
